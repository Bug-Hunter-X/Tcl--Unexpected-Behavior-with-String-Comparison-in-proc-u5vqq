This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Tcl procedure related to string comparison. The `badproc` procedure incorrectly handles comparisons, particularly when dealing with strings that might contain leading or trailing whitespace. The solution provides a corrected version that uses the `string equal` command for robust string comparisons, avoiding potential issues with whitespace or case sensitivity.
